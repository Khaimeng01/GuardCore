                We play an active role in community safety and crime prevention by collaborating with
                police-led programs and civil initiatives such as Rukun Tetangga. Guardcore supports public
                interest by promoting lawful behavior, participating in neighborhood outreach, and maintaining
                readiness to assist during emergencies. Our role extends beyond guarding â€” we help build safer
                communities.
